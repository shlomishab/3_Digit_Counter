# 3_Digit_Counter
VHDL design of a 3 digit counter, impalented on a Basys-3 FPGA board. Includes a Top Count input from the user that sets all the digits to 0, when the count reaches that digit. Example: if Top Count = 6, the 3 digit counter will cout up to 666. else, it will continue to 999. Top Count is programmable by the user via the on-board switches.
